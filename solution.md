This solution is built using a clean, controller-based .NET 8 Web API architecture that emphasizes simplicity, maintainability, and testability. The backend follows a structured and layered design approach to ensure separation of concerns and long-term scalability. The architecture consists of ASP.NET Core 8 Web API using controllers (not minimal APIs), Entity Framework Core as the ORM for database mapping, and a Repository Pattern implementation that includes both a GenericRepository and a TaskRepository. Additionally, a Unit of Work pattern is implemented to manage transactional consistency and coordinate repository operations efficiently.

Global Exception Handling middleware is configured to standardize error responses across the application using the ProblemDetails format, ensuring consistent and centralized error handling. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is specifically configured to allow communication with the React frontend running on [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). Swagger is integrated to provide automatic API documentation and interactive testing of endpoints during development. Logging is implemented using Serilog, which writes logs both to the console and to files for monitoring and debugging purposes. For testing, the solution uses xUnit together with FakeItEasy to enable unit testing and mocking.

Several key design decisions were made to support clean architecture principles. The Repository Pattern wraps the DbContext to provide a clean separation of concerns and to enable mock-based unit testing. This approach keeps controllers lean and focused strictly on handling HTTP requests and responses. The Global Exception Middleware centralizes all error handling logic and ensures consistent API responses using standardized ProblemDetails objects. The controller-based approach was selected for clarity, organization, and easier expansion in multi-endpoint APIs, particularly in structured CRUD applications.

The CORS policy is deliberately configured to allow requests from the React development server running on port 4200, ensuring seamless frontend-backend communication during development. The unit testing strategy leverages FakeItEasy to fake repository interfaces, allowing isolated testing of controller logic without interacting directly with Entity Framework Core or the database. Swagger further enhances development efficiency by enabling immediate interactive testing of all CRUD endpoints.

Overall, this solution focuses on maintainability, readability, and reliable development workflows. It is well-suited for CRUD-based applications and educational environments where clean layering, structured architecture, and testability are essential.

On the frontend, React was selected to build the user interface because it provides a strong, structured component model and integrates well with REST APIs in enterprise-style applications. The frontend solution is built using the latest version of React, TypeScript for type safety and improved maintainability, and Tailwind CSS for modern, utility-first styling. This combination ensures a scalable, clean, and maintainable user interface that complements the backend architecture.
